# Main branch

    PULL REQUESTS

    To ask for a pull request to the main branch firstly delete any code and/or comments made in main.lua
    This process needs to be done with the intent of giving anyone that uses this repo a blank canvas to start coding, 
    instead of a full page of unreadable code

# Branching tree

    PULL REQUESTS

    Contrary to the main branch, for pull requests you can leave the main.lua with any code considered essential to test the library you are working on.
    Every branch needs to be named after the library it's being worked on.
